# GPT NPC Custom Dialog Component
An Unreal Engine component for GPT-powered NPC dialogue. Working on 5.4. Requires a valid OpenAI API key. 

## Overview
This project provides a modular dialog component designed for Unreal Engine projects. This component was developed to enable verbose, accesable dialog for NPCs. You may tweak the given NPCs personality 
as you see fit, including things such as interests, danger topics (the NPC will not discuss), strength of traits, etc. 

## Status
Early development / prototype. In the future, I hope to enable facial rigging and sfx.
